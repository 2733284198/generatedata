<h3>What <i>is</i> this thing?</h3>

<p>
	The Data Generator provides a simple interface to let you quickly generate large volumes of custom data in a variety 
	of formats for use in testing software, populating databases, and so on. The <b>Generate</b> page contains the entire
	script: just fill in the page to construct the data set you're interested in, then click the Generate button. All 
	pretty self-explanatory, I hope!
</p>

<h3>Extend it!</h3>

<p>
	This version of the script (3.0.0+) is now fully extensible: developers can extend the core functionality to generate 
	new types of random data ("Data Types") and in new and interesting formats ("Export Types"). For people interested 
	in generating more accurate geographical data, they can also add new Country plugins that supply region names (states, 
	provinces, territories etc), city names and postal/zip code formats for their country of choice. 
</p>
