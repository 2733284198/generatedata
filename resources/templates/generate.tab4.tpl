<h3>What <i>is</i> this thing?</h3>

<p>
	Sometimes you need fake data for things like testing software, populating databases and so on. Some information is easy to fake:
	numbers, random alphanumeric strings and so on, but other information - like names and place names - require a little more legwork.
	This tool was written to simplify the process. It provides a simple interface to let you quickly generate large volumes of custom 
	data, in whatever format you require.
</p>
<p>
	The <b>Generate</b> page contains the entire script: just fill in the various fields in the page to construct the data set you're 
	interested in, then click the Generate button. Hey presto! Data! All pretty self-explanatory, I hope.
</p>

<h3>Extend it!</h3>

<p>
	The "out the box" script contains the sort of functionality you generally need. But nothing's ever complete - maybe you need 
	to generate esoteric math equations, pull random tweets or display random images from Flickr with the word "Red-backed vole" 
	in the title. Who knows. 
</p>
<p>
	With this in mind, the new version of the script (3.0.0+) was designed to be fully extensible: developers can extend the Core 
	functionality to generate new types of random data ("Data Types") and in new and interesting formats ("Export Types"). For 
	people interested  in generating more accurate geographical data, they can also add new Country plugins that supply region 
	names (states, provinces, territories etc), city names and postal/zip code formats for their country of choice.
