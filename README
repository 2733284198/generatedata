Ever needed custom formatted sample / test data, like, bad? Well, that's the idea of the Data Generator. It's a free, open source script written in JavaScript, PHP and MySQL that lets you quickly generate large volumes of custom data in a variety of formats for use in testing software, populating databases, and scoring with girls. 

There's a free online version found here:

This repository is for the latest version of the code, still currently under development. You can find a demo here:
http://beta.generatedata.com/

For a full, working copy of the script, download the 2.3.9 tag.

For (rather scanty) installation instructions, please see:

Some significantly improved documentation is coming soon. I'm busy working on other work until April/May of 2012, but will be returning to this project then.

Thanks!
