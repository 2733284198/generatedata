[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/benkeen/generatedata.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/benkeen/generatedata)

This is the repo for the standalone, downloadable version of [generatedata.com](http://www.generatedata.com).

Generally the trunk is pretty stable, but it's never guaranteed. If you're downloading the code, I'd suggest getting the most recent tag: https://github.com/benkeen/generatedata/releases

## How to Install / Documentation

For the installation instructions, user documentation and developer documentation, check out:
http://benkeen.github.io/generatedata/

Installation is really, really simple. I deliberately wrote the script to be as self-contained as possible and not require
additional PHP/Server configuration when setting it up. That said, it *does* require PHP 5.3.0 or later. See the documentation
for more info.

## Test Coverage

Test coverage is pretty weak right now! I'm in the midst of adding phpunit tests and integrating it with Travis, but it's going to be a little hairy for a while just yet.

## License

This script is freely available under the GPL 3 license. See license.txt in the root folder. Please note that all contributors agree that all code is released under this license.
