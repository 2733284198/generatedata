This is the repo for the standalone, downloadable version of beta.generatedata.com.

Generally the trunk is stable, but if you're concerned about stability above all else, grab one of the tags. The trunk contains the latest and greatest bug fixes and changes.

## Test Coverage

Test coverage is pretty weak right now! I'm in the midst of adding phpunit tests and integrating it with Travis, but it's going to be a little hairy for a while just yet.
