Sometimes you need fake data for things like testing software, populating databases and creating 
realistic-looking mockups. For text, we have lorem ipsum; but for everything else...? This tool was 
written to provide a quick and simple way to let you generate large volumes of custom data in 
whatever format you require. 

## Demo
### Version 1.0.0 
There's a free online version found on our website:
http://www.generatedata.com/#generator
The online demo is actually running a very old version of the code, no longer available.

### Version 2.x
Version 2 was never fully completed. A proof of concept was gotten up and running back in 2010, which 
added (basic) modularity and improved a few things, but I abandoned it in favour of some other projects
I was working on at the time. However, the tag is available if you want a copy.

### Version 3.0.0
http://www.generatedata.com

This is the main build, currently found on the public site.

## Versions

* 1.0.0 - found on our [live site](http://www.generatedata.com/#generator), but now very out of date.
* 2.3.9 - a refactored version of 1.0.0 offering a lot more options. This is fully functional and you
can [download it via the tag](https://github.com/benkeen/generatedata/tags).
* 3.0.0 - the current version.

## Installation

For (rather scanty) installation instructions of version 1 and 2 of the scripts, please see:
http://www.generatedata.com/#download

Version 3 has a built-in installation script and developer documentation. After installation, click 
on the Developer Doc link in the footer for information on how to extend the script. This is still
missing the Export Types doc section, but it'll be done very soon.
