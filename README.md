This is the repo for the standalone, downloadable version of beta.generatedata.com.

Generally the trunk is stable, but I haven't added continuous integration just yet (coming soon). If you're concerned
about stability above all else, grab one of the tags. The trunk contains the latest and greatest bug fixes and changes.
