Ever needed custom formatted sample / test data, like, bad? Well, that's the idea of the Data
Generator. It's a free, open source script written in JavaScript, PHP and MySQL that lets you
quickly generate large volumes of custom data in a variety of formats for use in testing software,
populating databases, and scoring with girls.

## Demo
There's a free online version found on our website:
http://www.generatedata.com/#generator

The online demo is actually running a very old version of the code, no longer available.

## Versions

* 1.0.0 - found on our [live site](http://www.generatedata.com/#generator), but now out of date.
* 2.3.9 - a refactored version of 1.0.0 offering a lot more options. This is fully functional and you
can [download it via the tag](https://github.com/benkeen/generatedata/tags).
* 3.0.0 - _currently under development_. This version is a complete re-write of 2.3.9.

## Installation

For (rather scanty) installation instructions of version 1 and 2 of the scripts, please see:
http://www.generatedata.com/#download

Version 3 has a built-in installation script. Much, much more documentation coming soon... first thing's
first: finish 3.0.0!
