		<h1>User Documentation</h1>

		<p>
			Sometimes you need fake data for things like testing software, populating databases and creating 
			realistic-looking mockups. For text, we have lorem ipsum; but for everything else...? This tool was 
			written to provide a quick and simple way to let you generate large volumes of custom data in 
			whatever format you require.

		<h1>Installation Types</h1>
		<p>
			The script was written to be installed and used within a local environment. Because people's needs are different,
			the <a href="install.php">installation script</a> lets you choose between the following installation types:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>A single, anonymous user account</b> - all saved configurations will be on this single user. No-one needs to 
				authenticate in order to access the script.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>A single user account, requires login</b> - the same as the previous option, except people need to log in
				to use the script and save data sets.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Multiple accounts</b> - this lets you set up any number of user accounts, each with their own login information.
				This option is perfect if you have a team, all of whom need to use the script to maintain their own data sets.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>Server Requirements</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>PHP 5.3 or later</li>
			<li>MySQL 4 or later</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>Github code vs. generatedata.com</h1>

		<p>
			The version of the script found at <a href="http://www.generatedata.com">generatedata.com</a> is a <b>private fork</b>
			of the open source script. I added in a few frills here and there - such as the option to donate to the project - 
			but the codebase is pretty much the same. The public site was written as a convenience for people who don't want to download and 
			install the script themselves - and for those who are willing to donate to keep the project going.
		</p>

		<h1>A Brief History</h1>
		<h3>Version 1.x</h3>

		<p>
			The first version of the script was completed back in 2005/2006. It was very basic, but in overall UI and design 
			it hasn't changed all that much to this day.
		</p>

		<h3>Version 2.x</h3>

		<p>Version 2 was never fully completed. A proof of concept was gotten up and running back in 2010, which 
		added (basic) modularity and improved a few things, but I abandoned it in favour of some other projects
		I was working on at the time. However, the tag is available on github if you want a copy.</p>

		<h3>Version 3.0.0</h3>

		<p><a href="http://beta.generatedata.com">http://beta.generatedata.com</a></p>

		<p>
			Currently the 3.0.0 branch is in beta, meaning it's <b>almost</b> production ready. The more feedback 
			I can get the better. This the version you'll want to download and use - and this is the version that these 
			documentation pages all cover. I'm working on this version currently (April 2013) and expect to get it 
			into final release in the next month or so.
