<p>Sometimes you need fake data for things like testing software, populating databases and creating 
realistic-looking mockups. For text, we have lorem ipsum; but for everything else...? This tool was 
written to provide a quick and simple way to let you generate large volumes of custom data in 
whatever format you require. </p>

<h2>Demo</h2>

<h3>Version 1.0.0</h3>

<p>There's a free online version found on our website:
<a href="http://www.generatedata.com/#generator">http://www.generatedata.com/#generator</a>
The online demo is actually running a very old version of the code, no longer available.</p>

<h3>Version 2.x</h3>

<p>Version 2 was never fully completed. A proof of concept was gotten up and running back in 2010, which 
added (basic) modularity and improved a few things, but I abandoned it in favour of some other projects
I was working on at the time. However, the tag is available if you want a copy.</p>

<h3>Version 3.0.0 beta</h3>

<p><a href="http://beta.generatedata.com">http://beta.generatedata.com</a></p>

<p>Currently the 3.0.0 branch is in beta, meaning it's <i>almost</i> production ready. The more feedback 
I can get the better. This the version I'd suggest downloading and using. I'm working on this version 
currently (April 2013) and expect to get it into final release in the next month or so.</p>

<h2>Versions</h2>

<ul>
<li>1.0.0 - found on our <a href="http://www.generatedata.com/#generator">live site</a>, but now very out of date.</li>
<li>2.3.9 - a refactored version of 1.0.0 offering a lot more options. This is fully functional and you
can <a href="https://github.com/benkeen/generatedata/tags">download it via the tag</a>.</li>
<li>3.0.0 - <em>currently in beta</em>. This version is a complete re-write of 2.3.9.</li>
</ul><h2>Installation</h2>

<p>For (rather scanty) installation instructions of version 1 and 2 of the scripts, please see:
<a href="http://www.generatedata.com/#download">http://www.generatedata.com/#download</a></p>

<p>Version 3 has a built-in installation script and developer documentation. After installation, click 
on the Developer Doc link in the footer for information on how to extend the script. This is still
missing the Export Types doc section, but it'll be done very soon.</p>
