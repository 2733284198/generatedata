					<h1>User Documentation</h1>

					<p class="alert alert-error">
						This whole section, and the other links above ain't done. Nope, not by a long shot. Feel free to look around, prod things, 
						click on things, etc. but don't be surprised when you get a 404 or other such stuff. It should be done in a day of two. Come back then.
						(this was written on April 23rd, 2013).
					</p>

					<p>
						This section contains a little meta info about the script. What it's all about, how to install it, where it 
						came from and blah blah blah. If you're a dev and want to extend it, (a) <i>sweet</i> and (b) visit the 
						<a href="developer.html">developer doc</a> section. It will <b>Blow. Your. Mind.</b> (not true).
					</p>

					<h3>What <i>is</i> this script again?</h3>
					<p>
						Sometimes you need fake data for things like testing software, populating databases and creating 
						realistic-looking mockups. For text, we have lorem ipsum; but for everything else...? This tool was 
						written to provide a quick and simple way to let you generate large volumes of custom data in 
						whatever format you require.
					</p>

					</p>

					<h1>Installation Types</h1>
					<p>
						The script was written to be installed and used within a local environment. Because people's needs are different,
						the <a href="install.php">installation script</a> lets you choose between the following installation types:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>A single, anonymous user account</b> - all saved configurations will be on this single user. No-one needs to 
							authenticate in order to access the script.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>A single user account, requires login</b> - the same as the previous option, except people need to log in
							to use the script and save data sets.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Multiple accounts</b> - this lets you set up any number of user accounts, each with their own login information.
							This option is perfect if you have a team, all of whom need to use the script to maintain their own data sets.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<hr size="1" />

					<h1>Server Requirements</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>PHP 5.3 or later</li>
						<li>MySQL 4 or later</li>
					</ul>

					<h1>Github code vs. generatedata.com</h1>

					<p>
						The version of the script found at <a href="http://www.generatedata.com">generatedata.com</a> is a <b>private fork</b>
						of the open source script. I added in a few frills here and there - such as the option to donate to the project - 
						but the codebase is pretty much the same. The public site was written as a convenience for people who don't want to download and 
						install the script themselves - and for those who are willing to donate to keep the project going. Good, solid, hardworking
						people. Salt o' the earth.
					</p>

					<hr size="1" />

					<h1>A Brief History</h1>
					<h3>Version 1.x</h3>

					<p>
						The first version of the script was completed back in 2005/2006. It was very basic, but in overall UI and design 
						it actually hasn't changed all that much to this day.
					</p>

					<h3>Version 2.x</h3>

					<p>
						Version 2 was never fully completed. A proof of concept was gotten up and running back in 2010, which 
						added basic modularity and improved a few things, but I abandoned it in favour of some other projects
						I was working on at the time. The tag is available on github if you want a copy, but I wouldn't bother.
					</p>

					<h3>Version 3.0.0</h3>

					<p><a href="http://beta.generatedata.com">http://beta.generatedata.com</a></p>

					<p>
						Currently the 3.0.0 branch is in beta, meaning it's <b>almost</b> production ready. The more feedback 
						I can get the better. This the version you'll want to download and use - and this is the version that these 
						documentation pages all cover. I'm working on this version currently (April 2013) and expect to get it 
						into final release in the next month or so.
