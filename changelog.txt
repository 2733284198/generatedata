3.0.7
-------

- LDIF Export Type support [thanks!]
- Proper (genuine!) French translation courtesy of []
- Optional JS, CSS minimization and bundling via Grunt. See help documentation for more information.
- PHP 5.5 compatibility fixes: database connection now with mysqli; Generator class renamed to DataGenerator due
to naming conflict.
- Bug fixes


TODO
- update doc for SecureSmarty() and for the $enableSmartySecurity config option.
- update doc to talk about minification and bundling.

Problems:
- how is Grunt going to detect the requireJS modules if they're outputted dynamically?
- is really going to download them all, always? Seems like this is the only viable alternative..
