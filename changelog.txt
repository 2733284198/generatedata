- PHP 5.5 compatibility fixes: database connection now with mysqli; Generator class renamed to DataGenerator due
to naming conflict.

TODO
- update doc for SecureSmarty() and for the $enableSmartySecurity config option.


Problems:
- how is Grunt going to detect the requireJS modules if they're outputted dynamically?
- is really going to download them all, always? Seems like this is the only viable alternative..
