3.0.7
-------

- LDIF Export Type support
- Full French translation
- JS, CSS minimization and bundling via Grunt. This is turned off by default for all commits to allow
for people to work locally without it. See help documentation for more information.
- For multiple-user installations, new settings to allow administrator to define default visible modules
(Countries, Data Types, Export Types, Translations), and option to allow users to customize their own list.
- Bug fixes [see github]
	- MSSQL single quote issue
	- ...


Problems:
- how is Grunt going to detect the requireJS modules if they're outputted dynamically?
- is really going to download them all, always? Seems like this is the only viable alternative...
