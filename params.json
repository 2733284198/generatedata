{"name":"Generatedata","tagline":"Open Source random data generator in JS, PHP and MySQL.","body":"# generatedata.com\r\n\r\nSometimes you need fake data for things like testing software, populating databases and creating \r\nrealistic-looking mockups. For text, we have lorem ipsum; but for everything else...? This tool was \r\nwritten to provide a quick and simple way to let you generate large volumes of custom data in \r\nwhatever format you require. \r\n\r\n## Demo\r\n### Version 1.0.0 \r\nThere's a free online version found on our website:\r\nhttp://www.generatedata.com/#generator\r\nThe online demo is actually running a very old version of the code, no longer available.\r\n\r\n### Version 2.x\r\nVersion 2 was never fully completed. A proof of concept was gotten up and running back in 2010, which \r\nadded (basic) modularity and improved a few things, but I abandoned it in favour of some other projects\r\nI was working on at the time. However, the tag is available if you want a copy.\r\n\r\n### Version 3.0.0 beta\r\nhttp://beta.generatedata.com\r\n\r\nCurrently the 3.0.0 branch is in beta, meaning it's <i>almost</i> production ready. The more feedback \r\nI can get the better. This the version I'd suggest downloading and using. I'm working on this version \r\ncurrently (April 2013) and expect to get it into final release in the next month or so.\r\n\r\n## Versions\r\n\r\n* 1.0.0 - found on our [live site](http://www.generatedata.com/#generator), but now very out of date.\r\n* 2.3.9 - a refactored version of 1.0.0 offering a lot more options. This is fully functional and you\r\ncan [download it via the tag](https://github.com/benkeen/generatedata/tags).\r\n* 3.0.0 - _currently in beta_. This version is a complete re-write of 2.3.9.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nFor (rather scanty) installation instructions of version 1 and 2 of the scripts, please see:\r\nhttp://www.generatedata.com/#download\r\n\r\nVersion 3 has a built-in installation script and developer documentation. After installation, click \r\non the Developer Doc link in the footer for information on how to extend the script. This is still\r\nmissing the Export Types doc section, but it'll be done very soon.\r\n\r\nBen Keen\r\n[@vancouverben](https://twitter.com/#!/vancouverben)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
